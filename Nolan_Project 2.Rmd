mydata
```

2. clean data
```{r}
kgs_calc <- 40 * 2.2
df_mydata <- mydata

df_mydata$Weight[df_mydata$Weight == '90lbs'] <- 90
df_mydata$Weight[df_mydata$Weight == '10 pounds'] <- 10
df_mydata$Weight[df_mydata$Weight == '60lbs'] <- 60
df_mydata$Weight[df_mydata$Weight == '35'] <- 35
df_mydata$Weight[df_mydata$Weight == '40kgs'] <- kgs_calc

df_mydata

```

3. analysis 
a. which dog breeds are less than 50lbs?
b. which dog breeds are heavier than 50lbs?
```{r}
df_mydata[order(as.numeric(as.character(df_mydata$Weight))),]

small <- df_mydata %>%
  filter(Weight < 50)
small$Breed

large <- df_mydata %>%
  filter(Weight > 50)
large$Breed
```
